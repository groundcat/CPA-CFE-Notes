# Borrowing Costs

- Only IFRS, IAS 23
- Not an ASPE issue

## Scope

- Interest spent on borrowing

- **Must capitalize** when

  - Relate to buying **qualifying asset**

- **"Qualifying asset":**

  - Takes **substantial time** to get ready for use / sale
  - **"Substantial"**: Not defined, could be > 6 months

- **"Asset"**:

  - Inventory

  - PPE, Construction of building

  - Investment property

  - Intangibles, etc.

- **Exception**:
  - **"May" choose not to capitalize interest <u>if</u> asset measured at FV**
  - (Capitalizing is **optional**)
  - e.g. PPE & investment properties under revaluation method

## Recognition (When Starts?)

- **Capitalize begins only when <u>ALL</u> 3 met:**
  - (a) Incurs **expenditures**
  - (b) Incurs **borrowing costs**; <u>and</u>
  - (c) **Activities** preparing asset for use / sale
- **Only allowed to capitalize <u>actual interests</u>** incurred
  - Not allowed to capitalize notional interest
- **Only possible to capitalize "<u>avoidable costs</u>" (related to specific asset)**
  - Borrow to finance an asset
  - Investment income eared on borrowed funds:
    - Net against capitalized costs

## General Borrowings (How Much?)

- Borrow for general operations & qualifying assets
  - Can't link to particular project
  - Need formula

**IFRS:**

- **Step 1. Capitalization % = Borrowing costs during period / Weighted-average borrowing during period**
  - (Finance competency, valuation)
  - Borrowing costs = Interest rate x Borrowing amount
  - Weighted-average borrowing = Debt outstanding x months / 12
- **Step 2. Average CV of qualifying asset relating to general borrowings**
  - Allocate to general borrowing, and then x months / 12, sum = Average expenditure
- **Step 3. Interest capitalized on general borrowings**
  - = Capitalization % x Average expenditure
- **Step 4. Total costs capitalized**
  - = Interest capitalized on general borrowings + Asset-specific borrowing - Interest income on asset-specific borrowing

**ASPE**

- **Not allowed to capitalize interest on general borrowings**

## Stopping Capitalization (When Ends?)

- **Stop capitalization** when <u>substantially</u> all activities complete
  - Small unfinished things are ok
- **Suspend capitalization** when development activities suspended
