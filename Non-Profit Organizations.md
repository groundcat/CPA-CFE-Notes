# Non-Profit Organizations

In real life, NPO has choice to adopt

- ASNPO or ASPE where applicable, or
- IFRS

In CFE, more likely to not adopt IFRS

## Fund Accounting

- Provide brief description for each fund
- Inter-fund transfers should be presented in statement of changes in net assets
  - Disclose amount and purpose, terms, inter-fund loans outstanding

### Fund Accounting - Revenue Recognition

2 methods for revenue recognition if using fund accounting

#### A. Deferral Method

- **Unrestricted contribution**
  - Recognize revenue
- **Endowment contribution** (interest only, not touch principal)
  - Recognize direct increase in net assets on B/S
- **Restricted contribution** (4 types)
  - **For expenses of current period**
    - Recognize <u>revenue</u>
  - **For expenses of a future period**
    - <u>Defer</u>, and
    - Recognize <u>revenue</u> in same period when <u>expenses</u> recognized
  - **For purchase of capital asset**
    - <u>Defer</u>, and
    - Recognize <u>revenue</u> on same <u>basis of amortization</u> expenses
    - <u>If no amortization</u>, recognize direct increase in <u>net assets</u> on B/S
  - **For repayment of debt**
    - Recognize based on <u>purpose of debt</u>
    - (If debt is for a 3-year program, recognize revenue over 3 years)

#### B. Restricted Fund Method

- **Unrestricted contribution**
  - Recognize <u>revenue</u>
  - In <u>general</u> fund
- **Endowment contribution**
  - Recognize <u>revenue</u>
  - In <u>endowment</u> fund
- **Restricted contribution** (2 types)
  - If **appropriate restricted fund**
    - Recognize <u>revenue</u> of appropriate restricted fund
  - If **<u>not</u> an appropriate restricted fund**
    - Use <u>deferral method</u>

#### Restriction of contribution

- Externally restricted by donor
- Internally restricted by BoD
- **Once if fund restricted, recognize as revenue**, but sacrifice matching principle?
  - It's fine for NPO, not worried about revenue manipulation

## Inventories

Measured at **lower of cost & current replacement cost**, when held for

1. Distribution at no charge or for a nominal charge, or
2. Consumption if production to be distributed at no charge or for a nominal charge

## Contributed Materials & Services (Non-cash)

May <u>choose</u> to recognize only when

1. **FMV** reasonably estimated, and
2. Used in **normal course** of operations, and
3. Otherwise **can be purchased**

**Measured at FMV** if reasonably estimated.

## Contributions Receivable (Pledges)

- **Recognize as <u>asset</u> if**
  - **Amount**  reasonably estimated
  - **Collection** reasonably assured
- **Must <u>disclose</u> when**
  - Amount recognized as asset at reporting date
  - Amount recognized as revenue in the period

## Tangible Assets

- If **gross average revenues** for current and preceding period **<u>< $500,000</u>, may <u>choose</u> to** 
  - Expense capital asset, or
  - Capitalize and not depreciate, or
  - Capitalize and depreciate 
- If **gross average revenues** for current and preceding period **<u>> $500,000, must</u>**
  - Capitalize and depreciate 
- Measurement
  - Measured at cost = FV of date of contribution
  - Use nominal value if FV not determinable

## Intangible Assets

- If **gross average revenues** for current and preceding period **<u>< $500,000</u>**, exception,
  - Can limit application of Section 3064 

### Intangibles Impairments

- Not apply S3064, but
- **Recognize expense** in statement of operations = 
  - **Excess of net CV over residual values**

## Collections

May **<u>choose</u>** to either

- **Expense** the collection
- **Capitalize** and **not depreciate**
- **Capitalize** and **depreciate**

For collections that are

- **Held for public** exhibition, education, research
- **Protected** and preserved
- **Proceeds** used by sales are **used for purchasing other collections**

## Controlled and Related Entities

### Controlled NPOs

**"Controlled"** when

- Can determine strategic operating, investing, financing
- Without consent of others

If one NPO controls another, should <u>either</u>

- **Consolidate**, <u>or</u>
- **Disclose controlled NPO**

So, consolidate or disclose?

- What needs to be disclosed? A lot:
  - Assets, liabilities, revenues, gains, expenses, CF, O/F/I activities, details of restrictions, etc.
- **Exceptions**: can choose **not to consolidate and disclosure, if**
  - Entities individually <u>immaterial</u>, and
  - Disclose reasons why not consolidated / disclosed

## Controlled Profit Organizations

When a NPO controls a for-profit organization,

**Report interest in joint venture**, under <u>either</u>

- **Proportionate consolidation** method, <u>or</u>
- **Equity method**

Also **disclose**

- **Policy** of reporting the interest
- Description of **relationship** with joint venture

## Significantly Influenced Organizations

When having significant influence over another **<u>NPO</u>**, **disclose**

- Relationship, SI organization's purpose, ITA status, legal form, nature and extent of economic interest in SI organization

When having significant influence over another **<u>for-profit organization</u>**,

- Use **equity method** to account for SI organization

## Economic Interest

Don't have control or SI, but still have relationship:

Have **economic interest when**

- **Resources** used for production is **held by other** organization
- **Responsible for liabilities of other** organization

**Disclose**

- At other organization's most recent reporting date
- Reporting period covered by financial information
- Significant details of events in intervening period
