# Intangible Assets - IAS 38 / ASPE S3064

Must demonstrate

1. Definitions (3) met
2. Recognition criteria met

## Definition

Intangible asset is

1. **identifiable** non-monetary, non-physical asset
2. entity must **control** asset
3. must have **future economic benefit**

### Identifiability

- Separable from goodwill
- Can be sold or rented by itself, or arises from legal contract (parent, license)

### Control

- Future economic benefits will come to you (controlled), not others
- Normally have legal right, or substance over form

### Future economic benefits

- Revenue, cost savings, any other benefits

## Recognition Criteria

To set up intangible, must

1. **Probable** future economic **benefits** flow to entity
2. **Cost** of asset reliably **measurable**

## Internally Generated Intangibles (R&D)

Research or development phase?

| Costs           | Definition                                                   | Treatment                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Research**    | Original investigation for gaining new knowledge<br />(Cannot yet demonstrate probable future benefits) | Expensed                      |
| **Development** | Application of research into plan / design for production    | Capitalized if 5 criteria met |

**Capitalize development costs if** 5 criteria met:

1. Technical feasibility
2. Intention and ability to complete
3. Market or usefulness
4. Availability of resources
5. Expenditures measured reliably

Internally generated assets that **cannot be distinguished** from developing costs are **not** recognize as **intangibles**: 

- Publishing titles,
- Customer lists, etc.

#### ASPE

- Allowed to expense development cost even if meet capitalize criteria
  - Depending on financial objectives (lower income)

## Measurement

### Initial Measurement

**Costs** to be included (what to be capitalized):

- **Purchase** price, taxes, less discounts/rebates
- **Directly-attributable** costs for **preparing**
- **Not** include **promotion, SG&A** costs normally

### IFRS - Subsequent Measurement

IFRS allows cost model or revaluation model 

#### Cost Model

- Cost - Accumulated Amortization and impairment losses

#### Revaluation Model

- FV at each B/S date
- If use revaluation model, all intangibles in class must also use revaluation model
- **Not use if no active market** for intangibles
  - Buy and sell frequently in a year
  - Unique assets usually don't have active market
- (CFE: Level C)

#### ASPE

- No revaluation under ASPE

### Amortization

- **Amortized over useful life, unless indefinite life**
  - Look at **substance over form**
  - E.g. Legally 5 years, but <u>if able to renew, in substance it's indefinite</u>
- **Residual value is zero**, unless
  - 1. Commitment from buyer at end of life
    2. Determined by existing market expected to exist
  - Usually, not met and RV = 0
- IFRS: not allowed to depreciate based on revenue, unless meet rebuttable presumption

#### IFRS vs. ASPE

- **Impairment of intangibles with indefinite life**, if value increases,
  - IFRS: allow reversal
  - ASPE: no reversal
- **Impairment test**
  - IFRS: test annually
  - ASPE: test only when indication

## Website Costs

Main issue: **Capitalize or Expense?**

- **Capitalize if future benefits**
  - Direct revenues
  - Not occur for websites solely for promoting & advertising (expensed)

**Must determine which stage**

- **Planning** stage
  - Feasibility study, defining objectives, evaluating alternatives
  - Similar to **research** phase, so <u>expensed</u>
- Application & Infrastructure **development**
  - Purchase software, domain, install, design
  - Similar to **development** stage, so <u>capitalized if conditions met</u>
- **Operating** stage
  - After development completed
  - <u>Expensed</u>
