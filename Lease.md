# Leases - IFRS 16

## Identify a Lease

A contract contains a lease if

- **Specifically identified asset** 
  - Ability to substitute
- **Specific period** of time
- Obtain **substantially all economic benefits**
  - Lessee benefits from asset
- **Right to control** of asset on
  - Type of output produced
  - When output produced
  - Where output produced
  - Whether output produced

## Lessee Accounting

### Exemptions

Recognize ROU asset & lease liability, **unless** either

- **Short-term** lease and **no purchase option**, or
  - Include periods of **extension options** that are **reasonably certain** to be exercised
- Asset **low value when new** (US$ 5,000 but judgement required)
  - On absolute (dollar amount) basis,  irrelevant to materiality
  - Look at each individual asset
  - May avoid recognizing lease by leasing multiple low value items

If meet exemptions above, 

- Option to elect recognize as lease **expense** each period

### Non-lease Components

Alternatives allowed:

- Choose to **separate**
  - Lower ROU asset & lease liability
  - Proportionally allocate based on relative **stand-alone prices (FMV)**
    - If not available, must be **estimated** by **observable** inputs
    - Not use inputs in lease contract b/c IFRS requires price allocated to be **fair**
- Choose **not to separate**
  - Higher ROU asset & lease liability
  - Treat entire contract as lease

### Initial Recognition

- Recognize ROU **when available to use** (commencement date)
- DR. ROU asset = PVMLP / CR. Lease liability = PVMLP

### Measurement of Lease Liability

**Lease liability** includes:

- **Fixed payments** (PMT)
- **<u>Certain</u> variable payments**
  - Include those **in substance are fixed** payments (based on an index or rate)
  - Not include percentage based variable payments
- **Residual value guarantee & Termination penalties**
  - Include if **reasonably certain to pay** (judgement required) 
- **Exercise price of purchase options**
  - Include if **reasonably certain to pay** (judgement required) 

Factors to consider: Not likely to terminate lease if

- Significant leasehold improvements
- Importance of asset to lessee
- Costs of relocation, new set up costs

### Measurement of Right-of-Use (ROU) Asset

**ROU asset** includes:

- **Lease liability** (see above), adjusted for:
- **Payments at/before lease contract commencement**
  - Commissions, legal
- **Initial direct costs**
- **Moving & restoring** costs, **ARO**
- **Less: Lease incentives** received

(Must be **incremental** costs)

### Discount Rate

- **I/Y = implicit rate, if reasonably determinable**
  - **Implicit rate**: Rate that makes PV MLP + unguaranteed residual value = FV of asset
- **Otherwise, I/Y = incremental borrowing rate (IBR)**
  - **IBR**: Rate that lessee would have to borrow to purchase the asset under similar term and type of asset

### Term of Lease

- **Non-cancellable** period
- **Extension** period when reasonably **certain** to exercise
- **Rent-free** period

### Subsequent Measurements of ROU Asset

#### Cost Model

**Initial ROU**, and then adjusted for:

- Less: **Accumulated depreciation** over time of
  - Useful life, if
    - Ownership transferred at end of lease, or
    - Purchase option reasonably certain to exercise
  - Otherwise, use **earlier** of
    - Useful life, or
    - Lease term
- Less: **Accumulated impairment** on ROU asset
  - Example: contamination of asset
- Plus/Less: **Gains & losses** recognized if lease liability and ROU **revalued**
  - When variables change

#### Revaluation Model

Option to use revaluation model if

- Revaluation with sufficient regularity 

- FV model

### Subsequent Measurements of Lease Liability

**Initial lease liability**, and then adjusted for:

- **Interest expense**
  - Effective interest method
  - I/Y unchanged, unless
    - Lease term changed
    - Purchase option amount changed
- **Payments** made
  - Reduces liability
- **Re-measurement** if 
  - payment linked to index, or 
  - substantial modifications to lease

**ROU also adjusted** for items above

- **Interest and amortization expense** also adjusted based on new info

Entries:

```
DR. Interest expense / CR. Liability
DR. Lease liability / CR. Cash payment
DR. Amortization expense / CR. Accumulated amortization
```

## Lessor Accounting

Key differences:

- Initial cost of asset may often be less since lessor may buy in bulk

- Lessor may expect residual value and may be quite high

- Lessor can have tax shield early tax savings from CCA (*all leases are operating leases for tax)

### Classify a Lease

#### Finance Lease

- **Transfer substantially all risks & rewards of asset**

- **Primary indicators:**
- Transfer title at end
  - BPO
  - Lease term is major part of economic life
  - PV of lease payments substantially all FV of asset
  - Asset has specialized nature (only lessee can use without major modifications)
  
- **Other indicators:**
- Lessor's loss on cancellation borne by lessee
  - Gains/losses of FV accrue to lessee
  - Bargain renewal (less than market value)

#### Operating Lease

- **NOT** transfer substantially all risks & rewards of asset

### Accounting for Finance Lease

#### Direct Financing (Lessor financial intermediary)

- Purchase an asset and immediately leased
- Profit from **lease interest**

#### Sales Type Lease (Manufacturers)

- Lease to lessee from **inventory**
- **Revenue** when property sold

### Accounting for Operating Lease

- Leased **asset** on B/S
  - Amortized
  - Initial direct costs added to asset CV
  - Other costs expensed
- Lease **revenue** recognized when payments due

### Lease of Land and Buildings

- Assessed **separately** as a finance / operating lease

### Head Lease and Sublease

- Head lease and sublease accounted for separately
- If head lease is short-term, then sublease should be an operating lease
  - Otherwise sublease is ROU asset arising from head lease

# Leases - ASPE Sec. 3065

## Lessee Accounting

### Identify a Lease

#### Capital Lease

Criteria: **Substantially all risks & rewards transferred**, otherwise operating lease

Meet one condition:

- **Transfer title** after lease
- **Bargain purchase option (BPO)**: will exercise
- **Lease term $\geq$ 75%** economic life, **or**
- **PV MLP  $\geq$ 90% FV** at lease inception

Recognition:

- Record **asset & liability** at PV of lease payments
- Record **amortization expense** for asset
- Record **interest expense** for liability

#### Operating Lease

- Record **lease expense** each period

### Initial Costs

- **Always expensed** by lessee
  - Delivery, construction expenses
- NOT capitalized to asset, unlike IFRS

### Uneven Payments

- Free rent, lump sum payments, etc.
- Amortized over initial lease term
  - Lease expense each year = Total payments / Total terms

### Term of Lease

Includes:

- **All terms before exercising BPO**
- **BPO renewal term**
  - Payments substantially lower than market price (judgement required)
- **Renewal terms at lessor's option**
  - Lessor wants the lessee to renew

### Minimum Lease Payments (MLP)

MLP =

- Include (+) **Guaranteed residual value**
  - Value guaranteed to lessor at end
- Include (+) **BPO price**
- Exclude (-) **Operating/executory costs** 
  - insurance, maintenance
- Exclude (-) **Contingent lease payment** (cannot estimate)
  - based on subsequent events ($ per km)

### Discount Rate

Lower of

- Implicit rate
- IBR

### Subsequent Measurements

Amortization over time of

- Lease term if no BPO or title transfer
- Economic life if BPO or title transfer

Depreciable amount = PV - guaranteed residual value

Entries (same as IFRS):

```
DR. Interest expense / CR. Liability
DR. Lease liability / CR. Cash payment
DR. Amortization expense / CR. Accumulated amortization
```

## Lessor Accounting

### Capital Lease

- **Step 1 - Meet at least 1 criteria for lessee**
- **Step 2 - Meet both 2 additional criteria:**
  - Credit risk of lessee must be normal
  - Un-reimbursable costs to be borne by lessor must be estimable

### Interest Rate Discounting

For both capital lease & finance lease:

- Implicit rate (if known)
