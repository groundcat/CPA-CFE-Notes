# Investment Property

**Only under IFRS**

ASPE: same as PP&E

## Definition

Investment property is

- Land or building
- Used to **earn rent** and/or **capital appreciation**
- **<u>Unless</u>** for
  - Use in **production or admin** (considered "**owner occupied**" and are <u>accounted as **PPE**</u>)
  - **Sale** in ordinary business, accounted as **<u>inventory</u>**
- Held by owner or lessee (under financial lease)

### Property as both investment property & PPE

Used for both rent / appreciation AND owner occupied

- **If proportions can be sold (or leased) separately**
  - Accounted for **separately** as investment property & PPE
- **If cannot be sold (or leased) separately**
  - It's an investment property **only if an insignificant portion is owner occupied**
    - e.g. 10% or 20% 

Other factors

- If **services provided is significant**
  - Considered as owner occupied PPE, not investment property
  - E.g. Owns and operates a hotel

## Initial Recognition

- Measured at cost
  - Include direct costs: legal fees, taxes

## Subsequent Recognition

- Terminology different from PPE
- When property interest held by lessee under operating lease
  - Must use FV model
- When FV not reliably measurable
  - Use cost model
- Otherwise, **<u>two choices:</u>**
  - **FV model**
  - **Cost model**
- Must be consistent to all investment properties, unless not able to measure FV reliably (not common)

### Cost Model

- Measure all investment properties **using PP&E standard** (IAS 16)
- Still need to disclose FV

### FV Model

- **Changes in FV goes to gain or loss (I/S)**

  - So, FV model could be more favorable

- **No depreciation** is taken

- Different from PPE!

  Vs. PPE:

  - Changes in FV goes to OCI
  - Depreciation

- Cannot switch to cost model, unless

  - Market transaction infrequent, estimation unavailable

### Determine the FV

- Rebuttable presumption
  - That entity can determine FV
- Exceptional cases
  - Cost used because FV not determinable (not common)

## Transfers (Change In Use)

### Transfer <u>out of</u> classification of investment property

- **Only when**
  - **Change in use**
- <u>Not</u> when
  - Change in management's intention

| Change in use        | Treatment                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Move in the building | Switch to PPE standard       |
| Sale the building    | Switch to inventory standard |

### Transfer <u>into</u> classification of investment property

- Does the bump-up go to P/L or OCI?
- When
  - **Owner occupation ends**
    - If FV model used, difference between CV and FV goes to **OCI**
  - **Formerly inventory**, now owner **(operating) lease** to others
    - If FV model used, difference between CV and FV goes to **P/L**
