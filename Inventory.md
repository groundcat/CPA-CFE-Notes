# Inventory - IAS 2 / ASPE S3031

## Definition

Inventories (assets):

- Held for sale, ordinary business
- WIP, or
- Materials or supplies consumed in production

## Measurement

Inventory = **Lower of Cost & NRV**

- Manipulated by not writing down to NRV

### Cost

Costs include

- Purchase costs
- Conversion costs
- Other costs bringing it to current location / condition

**Overhead costs**: Must allocate FOH / VOH based on <u>normal capacity</u>

- Allocated on units # that are <u>usually</u> produced
- Admin OH not normally allocated

Must use FIFO / weighted average, unless specific identification

### NRV

- NRV is entity-specific, based upon contract price
- Compare cost vs. NRV for each item
- **Write down if Cost > NRV**
  - Item by item, or
  - Allowed to group similar or related items

### Changes in Fair NRV

- Each period, assess NRV
- **Reverse write down** if NRV increases
  - Through P & L
  - Reverse only **up to the previous value**, not to FV
