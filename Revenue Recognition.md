# Revenue Recognition

## Revenue Recognition - IFRS 15

### Step 1. Identify the Contract

Criteria:

- **Contract approved** (written/oral) and both parties **committed** to perform obligations
- **Goods and services identified**
- **Payments and terms identified**
- Contract has **commercial substance** (economic benefit)
- **Collection probable**, more likely than not (51%)

**If collection not probable,**

- Can't recognize revenue
- Cash received is **unearned revenue**, recognized when either
  - No remaining obligation and most of consideration received and non-refundable, or
  - Contract terminated and consideration received is non-refundable

### Step 2. Identify Distinct Performance Obligation

Goods and services must be either

- **Distinct**, or
  - **Capable of being distinct**: Customer can be benefited from good or service on its own
    - If these can be sold separately?
    - Independent value?
  - **Distinct within context of contract**: Goods or service separately identifiable
    - No significant integration or highly dependent with other promised goods or services
- Part of a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially same

### Step 3. Determine Transaction Price

Price = Price specified in the contract, but need to consider:

- **Variable consideration** & constraining estimates
  - Expected value method (@EV), or
  - Most likely amount
- **Non-cash consideration**
- **Discount**
- **Returns**
- **Payable to customer**

### Step 4. Allocate Price to Performance Obligation

If **multiple deliverables**, allocate price @ FV = stand-alone selling price

Steps:

- Determine stand-alone price
  - Price would have to be sold
- If stand-alone price not observable, estimate amount by
  - Adjusted Market Assessment approach (how much each product would sell for individually)
  - Expected Cost Plus Margin approach

### Step 5. Recognize when Performance Obligation Satisfied

#### IFRS Control Model

- Control
  - Ability to direct the use of asset
  - Obtain substantially all benefit (potential cash inflows or savings in outflows)
- Control passes when customer has
  - a present obligation to pay
  - physical possession of the asset
  - legal title
  - risks and rewards of ownership
  - accepted the asset

#### Consignment Arrangements

Entity may transfer goods physically, but still maintain control.

#### Bill-and-hold arrangements

Entity may transfer goods physically, but still maintain control.

### Progress Over Time

#### Control Transfers <u>Over Time</u>

control transferred over time if either

- Customer **simultaneously** receives and consumes economic benefits provided by the vendor’s performance, **over a time period**
- Vendor creates or enhances **an asset controlled by the customer**, **<u>or</u>**
- Vendor’s performance does **not** create an asset for which the vendor has an **alternative use** and vendor has an **enforceable right to payment** for performance completed to date.
  - specialized asset, only customer can use
  - standard asset (others could use), but there is a particular restriction so only this customer can use it
  - vendor would incur significant losses if asset sold elsewhere
- *Enforceable payment – vendor can enforce payment for work done to date in all circumstances.*

#### Measuring Progress Over Time

##### Output Methods

- Appraisals of results achieved

- Milestones reached

- Survey of work completed

- Time elapsed

- Units produced or delivered

##### Input Methods

- Resources consumed

- Machine hours used

- Labour hours expended

- Time elapsed

- Costs incurred

##### Zero Profit Method

- When it is difficult to measure the final outcome but the entity expects to recover costs

- Recognize revenue only to the extent of costs incurred to date

### Contract Costs

#### Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract

i.e. selling, marketing costs

**Capitalized** if

- Cost is incremental, **and**
- Meet criteria to be capitalized as fulfillment costs, or
- Incremental costs expected to be recovered

**Expensed** if 

- Not incremental, **or**
- Expected period of amortization is one year or less

#### Costs to Fulfill a Contract

- Determine if **other IFRS Sections** apply (i.e. Inventories, PPE etc.) – if yes, apply other Sections.
- If other Sections do not apply, **capitalize** costs if all criteria met:
  - Costs identifiable to the contract
  - Costs generate or enhance resources of the vendor that will be used to satisfy performance obligations in the future
  - Costs are expected to be recovered

#### Impairment of Costs Capitalized

- Impairment loss when carrying amount > recoverable amount
  - Recoverable amount = Price expected - Costs to sell

- Apply impairment model in the following order:
  1. Apply existing impairment guidance (i.e. Inventory Section)
  2. Apply IFRS 15
  3. Apply impairment model for CGUs

##### Impairment Reversal

- Reverse impairment loss when impairment conditions cease to exist
- Reversal is limited to writing up the asset to the carrying amount, net of amortization, had no impairment loss been recognized
