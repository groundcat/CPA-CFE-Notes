# Financial Instruments

- IFRS 9, IAS 32
- ASPE 3856

##  Classification & Presentation

- Substance over form
- **Financial liability**
  - (a) Contractual obligation
    - to deliver cash (or other financial asset), or
    - under unfavorable conditions exchange financial A/L
  - (b) Contract to be settled in entity's own equity, and
    - Non-derivative & variable number of shares, or
    - Derivative & fixed number of shares
  - Part (b) not included in ASPE

### Preferred Shares & Puttable instrument

- **Preferred shares**
  - Usually equity, <u>unless</u>
  - (a) **Mandatory redeemable P/S** for fixed number of shares [Liability]
    - Company obligated
  - (b) **Retractable P/S** [Liability]
    - Shareholders can force company to redeem shares
    - **Current liability** if can redeem starting from now
    - **Non-current liability** if can redeem only after 1 year
  - **<u>ASPE</u>: equity, if P/S issued for tax-planning**
    - Need disclosure
- **Puttable instrument** [Liability]
  - Holder can put shares back to company and force company to buy shares
  - Company obligation to pay cash

- Legally equity (shares), but classified liability
  - I/S treatment follows B/S
  - Dividends classified as interest expense
  - G/L on redemption not a capital transaction, treated similar to premium/discount
    - Amortize over life of redemption years

- When redemption demanded by shareholder
  - No longer an equity
  - Reclassify to liability
    - Liability measured at redemption amount
  - Re-measurement adjustment recognized in R/E

```
When redemption demanded:
Dr. Equity 	1,000,000 (amount when share issued)
Dr. R/E 	200,000
	Cr. Liability 	1,200,000 (redemption price)
```

### Contingent Settlement Provision

- Settle when uncertain events beyond control of both issuer and holder

**IFRS**:

- **Liability** by default, <u>unless</u>
  - <u>Not genuine</u> (uncertain events <u>not likely</u> to happen) [Equity]

**ASPE**:

- **Equity** by default, <u>unless</u>
  - **Liability** if <u>event highly likely to occur</u>

### Compound Financial Instruments

- Have both liability & equity component

#### Convertible Bond

- Bond holder can either
  - Wait bond mature and collect -- Liability
  - Convert into C/S before maturity -- Equity
- Key: how to allocate proceeds to liability & equity

**IFRS**:

- <u>Deduct liability</u> component from FV (total proceeds)
  - Value of liability component = PV of interest and principal
- <u>Residual is equity</u> component

**ASPE: 2 methods allowed**

- Method 1
  - Allocate <u>all proceeds to liability</u>
  - Equity component zero
- Method 2
  - Allocate proceeds to liability/equity
  - Residual is the least easily measurable component

### Settlement in Own Equity Instruments

- Obligation to settle by company's own shares, rather than paying cash
- If obligated to issue **fixed number of shares**
  - Equity
- If obligated to issue **variable number of shares**
  - Liability

### Offsetting Financial A & L

- Allowed to offset (only show net), <u>when</u>
  - Legally **enforceable right** to set off, <u>and</u>
  - Intends to **settle on net** basis / **realize A & L simultaneously**

## Initial Measurement

- **IFRS**: Financial A & L
  - Measured at **FV + Transaction costs** (directly attributable)
    - **Exception**: Not include transaction costs if FVTPL
- **ASPE**:
  - When FV measurement not used,
    - Required to capitalize transaction costs
- When arm's length, consideration is usually FV
