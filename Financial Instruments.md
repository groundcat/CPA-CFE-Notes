# Financial Instruments

- IFRS 9, IAS 32
- ASPE 3856

##  Classification & Presentation

- Substance over form
- **Financial liability**
  - **(a) Contractual obligation**
    - to deliver <u>cash</u> (or other financial asset), <u>or</u>
    - under <u>unfavorable</u> conditions exchange financial A/L
  - **(b) Contract to be settled in entity's own equity**, <u>and</u>
    - <u>Non-derivative & variable</u> number of shares, <u>or</u>
    - <u>Derivative & fixed</u> number of shares
  - Part (b) not included in ASPE

### Preferred Shares & Puttable instrument

- **Preferred shares**
  - Usually equity, <u>unless</u>
  - (a) **Mandatory redeemable P/S** for fixed number of shares [Liability]
    - Company obligated
  - (b) **Retractable P/S** [Liability]
    - Shareholders can force company to redeem shares
    - **Current liability** if can redeem starting from now
    - **Non-current liability** if can redeem only after 1 year
  - **<u>ASPE</u>: equity, if P/S issued for tax-planning**
    - Need disclosure
- **Puttable instrument** [Liability]
  - Holder can put shares back to company and force company to buy shares
  - Company obligation to pay cash

- **Legally equity (shares), but classified liability**
  - I/S treatment follows B/S
  - Dividends classified as interest expense
  - G/L on redemption not a capital transaction, treated similar to premium/discount
    - Amortize over life of redemption years

- **When redemption demanded by shareholder**
  - No longer an equity
  - Reclassify to liability
    - Liability measured at redemption amount
  - Re-measurement adjustment recognized in R/E

```
When redemption demanded:
Dr. Equity 	1,000,000 (amount when share issued)
Dr. R/E 	200,000
	Cr. Liability 	1,200,000 (redemption price)
```

### Contingent Settlement Provision

- Settle when uncertain events beyond control of both issuer and holder

**IFRS**:

- **Liability** by default, <u>unless</u>
  - <u>Not genuine</u> (uncertain events <u>not likely</u> to happen) [Equity]

**ASPE**:

- **Equity** by default, <u>unless</u>
  - **Liability** if <u>event highly likely to occur</u>

### Compound Financial Instruments

- Have both liability & equity component

#### Convertible Bond

- Bond holder can either
  - Wait bond mature and collect -- Liability
  - Convert into C/S before maturity -- Equity
- Key: how to allocate proceeds to liability & equity

**IFRS**:

- **<u>Deduct liability</u> component from FV (total proceeds)**
  - Value of liability component = PV of interest and principal
- **<u>Residual is equity</u> component**

**ASPE: 2 methods allowed**

- **Method 1**
  - **Allocate <u>all proceeds to liability</u>**
  - Equity component zero
- **Method 2**
  - Allocate proceeds to liability/equity
  - **Residual is the least easily measurable component**

### Settlement in Own Equity Instruments

- Obligation to settle by company's own shares, rather than paying cash
- If obligated to issue **fixed number of shares**
  - Equity
- If obligated to issue **variable number of shares**
  - Liability

### Offsetting Financial A & L

- Allowed to offset (only show net), <u>when</u>
  - Legally **enforceable right** to set off, <u>and</u>
  - Intends to **settle on net** basis / **realize A & L simultaneously**

## Initial Measurement

- **IFRS**: Financial A & L
  - **Not FVTPL**:
    - Measured at **FV + Transaction costs** (directly attributable)
  - **FVTPL**:
    - Measured at **FV**
- **ASPE**:
  - When FV measurement not used,
    - Required to capitalize transaction costs
- When arm's length, consideration is usually FV

## Subsequent Measurement

3 categories:

- **Amortized cost**
  - Amortize using effective interest method
- **FVOCI**
  - Changes in FV reflected in OCI
- **FVTPL**
  - Changes in FV reflected in P&L

### Amortized Cost

- **Only used for <u>debt</u> instrument**

2 conditions to use AC:

- **Hold-to-collect test**; <u>and</u>
  - Holding investment within business model 
  - Objective is collecting cash flow
  - No intention to sell before maturity, <u>unless</u>
    - if expected to occur in future, and proceeds approximately same to proceeds at maturity
    - if sell because increase in credit risk (to get rid of junk bond)
    - if unexpected cash needs
    - if sell for restructuring / business combination
- **SPPI test**
  - Contract terms for cash flows soly payments of principal & interest (SPPI)
  - **Meet SPPI** when there is a **basic lending arrangement**
    - pay interest that reflects: 
      - TVM, or
      - credit risk
    - zero interest
      - zero coupon bond
  - **Not meet SPPI** when
    - Risks or volatility not related to basic lending arrangement
      - e.g. based on S&P index, commodity prices, profitabilit of lender
      - not giving contractual cash flows that are SPPI

Examples that use AC:

- trade receivable
- basic loan
- government / corp bond

### FVOCI

- Used for debt / equity instruments

#### FVOCI - Debt Instruments

2 conditions to use FVOCI:

- Invest for **<u>both</u> collecting CF + selling**; <u>and</u>
  - frequently sales
  - sell before maturity
- **SPPI test** (same condition as AC)

#### FVOCI Accounting

- Instruments revalued at FV
  - using effective interest method (same as AC)
- **Goes to P&L**
  - Credit loss/reversal
  - Interest income 
  - FX gain/loss
- **Goes to OCI**
  - Other changes in CV on remeasurement to FV
- When instrument sold, can take past cumulative OCI to P & L

#### FVOCI - Equity Instruments
