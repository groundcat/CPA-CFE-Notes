# Asset Retirement Obligations

- ASPE 3110 - ARO
- IAS 37 - Provisions
- Similar

## Identify an ARO

- Spend when retire a **tangible long-lived asset**
- **Permanently retired**
  - Sell or dispose

**ASPE**:

- **Legal obligation**, or
- **Promissory estoppel**
  - Promissory estoppel: May not be legally enforceable but you promised to do so

**IFRS**:

- **Legal obligation**, or
- **Constructive obligation**
  - Not "legal" obligation, but a promise with valid expectation

## Initial Measurement

### Set up ARO?

- **Reasonable estimate** of obligated amount
  - Does NOT have to be FV
  - Consider technical changes, new legislation that are **virtually certain**
- **If cannot estimate**
  - Liability recognized when estimate can be made
  - Set ARO only when you have reasonable estimate

### **When recognize?**

- If ARO is **one-time** (not related to use of asset)
  - Recognize whole amount at beginning, no need to PV
- If ARO **related to use of asset** (e.g. contamination)
  - Recognize each year over use of asset
  - Usually a long-term obligation, **"may" use PV**
  - ARO added to CV 
    - (Dr. Asset / Cr. ARO)
    - But no need to include the incremental CV to depreciation

## Subsequent Measurement

- Each year, period-to-period changes recognized for

  - Changes in accretion of PV of liability
  - Changes in estimation (time, CF in PV calculation)

- Expense

  - Under **ASPE**:
    - Called "**Accretion expense**", operating item on I/S
  - Under **IFRS**:
    - "**Interest expense**"

  - Year 1: Accretion expense = I% x Initial value of ARO
    - Dr. Accretion expense / Cr. ARO
  - Year 2: Accretion expense = I% x (Initial value of ARO + PY Accretion expense)
    - Dr. Accretion expense / Cr. ARO

## Adjustments to ARO

- Change of estimate (Prospectively), **<u>only</u> allowed to reduce ARO when**
  - **<u>Sufficient</u> evidence** that future **technology** brings down costs
  - **Virtually (90%) <u>certain</u>** new **legislation**
  - (Standards are high)
- **IFRS**:
  - If obligation reduced by more than the asset's value, resulting in profit in P & L
