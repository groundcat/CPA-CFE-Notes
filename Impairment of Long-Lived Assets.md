# Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

## Scope

|          | Scope                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ASPE** | PPE and intangibles with finite lives                        |
| **IFRS** | **Also:**<br />Intangibles with indefinite lives<br />Goodwill<br />Investments<br />Current assets (where impairment not in other std.) |

**Looking for 4 issues:**

| Issues          |                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Measurement** | How much to write down? |
| **Impairment**  | When to write down?     |
| **Grouping**    | Combine A/L?            |
| **Reversal**    | Allowed to reverse?     |

## Measurement

Impairment loss when CV not recoverable

- Recoverable amount (RA) is <u>different</u> from ASPE to IFRS

### ASPE

**Write down when?** 

- CV not recoverable **if undiscounted CF > RA from use <u>and</u> disposition**

**Write down by how much?**

- Impairment loss = **CV - FV**
- Write down to FV

### IFRS

**RA** = <u>higher</u> of

- **FV - Cost to sell**
- **Value in use** = <u>PV</u> of CF from use + disposal - disposal costs

**Write down when?** 

- Write down if RA < CV

**Write down by how much?**

- Impairment loss = **CV - RA**
- Write down to RA

## Testing for Impairment

|          | Impairment Test                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IFRS** | At end of each period,<br /><u>Any</u> **indications** of impairment<br />Actively looking for indications, ongoing |
| **ASPE** | Only when see factors indicate an impairment<br />No need to actively look for indication |

### Exceptions for IFRS

For assets below, **must test annually even if no indications:**

- Intangibles with indefinite lives
- Intangibles not ready for use
- Goodwill

When to test?

- Any time, at least once, in the year
- But must be <u>consistent</u>
- Test not avoidable if shorter than 12 months

## Grouping Assets & Liabilities

Allowed to group A/L to test for impairment

|          | Grouping                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IFRS** | CGU (Cash Generating Unit)                                   |
| **ASPE** | Group at lowest level<br />for which identifiable CF are largely independent<br />(will be given in exams) |

**IFRS**

- Allocated to CGU or group of CGUs
- Impairment loss allocated to
  - **Goodwill**, and then
  - **Remaining**: rest of assets on **pro-rate** basis of CV (similar to ASPE)

- **Never write down below RA** or below 0

**ASPE**

- Write down on **pro-rate** basis on **only long-lived** assets
- Don't write down <u>non</u>-long-lived assets
  - e.g. A/R is current assets, cannot write down
- **Never write down below FV**

## Reversal of Impairment Losses

|          | Reversal allowed?                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IFRS** | Reversal allowed if RA changed<br /><u>Exception: Goodwill</u> not allowed to reverse |
| **ASPE** | Reversal <u>not allowed</u>                                  |
