# Property, Plant and Equipment

- ASPE S3061 / IAS 16

## Definition of PPE

- Held **for production**
- Include **bearer plants**
  - Living plants used in production (e.g. Apple trees)
  - Do not apply agriculture section

**PPE vs. investment property**

- Investment property is under another section
  - Investment property: held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation

## Measurement

### Initial Measurement

- At **cost**, <u>including</u>
  - **Directly attributable costs** in bringing/preparing asset
  - Installation, site preparation, capitalized interest, etc.
- <u>Not</u> include
  - General & admin OH
- **Incidental operations** revenue & expenses
  - **IFRS**: <u>not</u> included in cost, but go to I/S
  - **ASPE**: included in cost

### Subsequent Measurement

**IFRS** has 2 models

- Cost model
- Revaluation model

Model must be **consistent within a specific class**

- "Classes" are not defined
- Land, land and buildings, machine, equipment, etc.

**ASPE** has only

- Cost model

#### Cost Model

- Most commonly used
- PPE = Cost - AD - Impairment loss

#### Revaluation Model

- FV at each reporting date
- Revalue not necessary every year, but FV must not materiality different from CV
- Frequency of revaluation depends on nature

##### **First Revaluation**

- Value **increased > Cost**
  - Cr. OCI (not P&L)
  - Only amount above cost goes to OCI
- Value **decreased < Cost**
  - Dr. P&L

##### **Subsequent Revaluation**

- Value **increased**
  - Cr. OCI only for amount above original cost
  - Cr. P&L to reverse previous revaluation
- Example
  - 100 --> 80
    - Dr. P&L 20
  - and then 80 --> 110
    - Cr. P&L 20
    - Cr. OCI 10

#### Qualitative Discussion on Revaluation Method

- When value increase
  - Good for B/S because higher asset
  - But higher depreciation expense on I/S
- Need to tie in client's objectives
  - Cares more about B/S or I/S?

## Depreciation

- Over useful life
- Original cost - Residual value

### Depreciation Formula under IFRS

- Depreciation = (Original cost - (<u>Residual</u> value - Disposition cost)) / <u>Useful</u> life

### Depreciation Formula under ASPE

- Depreciation = <u>greater</u> of
  - (Cost - <u>Salvage</u> value) / <u>life</u>
  - (Cost - <u>Residual</u> value) / <u>useful life</u>
- Not required to review useful life, residual value, amortization method annually, unless indications of
  - change in extent of use
  - significant tech development
  - change in law, environment

### Key Terms

- **Residual vs. Salvage**
  - Residual value = Value when get rid of asset (may continue life elsewhere) at end of useful life
  - Salvage value = Value when asset scrapped (at end of life)
- **Useful life vs. Life**
  - Useful life is for the entity, not real life of asset
  - Life expected to use
  - Number of units expected to be obtained from use

### Methods for Depreciation

- **IFRS allows increasing charge method**
  - Not allowed under ASPE
- **IFRS does <u>not</u> allow depreciation based on <u>revenue</u>**
  - Allowed under ASPE

### Depreciation of Components

- **IFRS, <u>must</u> separately depreciate <u>major</u> parts / components**
  - that are significant in relation to asset total cost
  - cost of asset allocated to parts / components
  - depreciate over useful life, separately

- **ASPE, when <u>practicable</u>, separately depreciate <u>significantly separable</u> parts / component**

#### Component Replaced

- **IFRS**: For component that is replaced, need to be de-recognized
  - Lead to G & L
- **ASPE**: pooled so no need to de-recognize

## Capitalization vs. Expensing

### ASPE: Betterments vs. Repairs

- Betterments vs. Repairs
- Betterments
  - added to cost of completed asset
- Betterment (enhance service potential for a PPE) if
  - increase in output or capacity
  - lower operating costs
  - life or useful life extended
  - quality of output improved

### **IFRS**

- <u>Not</u> distinguish Betterments vs. Repairs
- Costs in maintenance of service potential is a repair, so expensed
